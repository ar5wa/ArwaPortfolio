									<p>This is a fast-paced arcade experience where you pilot a rocket or jet-powered craft, aiming to stay airborne as long as possible by collecting scattered fuel tanks along the way. The more fuel you collect, the farther you can travel while avoiding obstacles. The level design and visual style are inspired by the atmosphere of Interstellar, with unique touches that give the game its own identity. Currently under development, with ongoing improvements to graphics, movement mechanics, and level design.</p>

									<p>my The second game I worked on was a group project, completed in one week. The game follows a robot in a high-tech city that has been overrun by a virus, causing glitches and destruction. As the sole survivor, the robot must defeat enemies and collect the core elements to save the city before the glitches consume it. All props were designed in Maya, and the game was developed using Unity</p>

A high-energy space combat game where the player commands an advanced fighter jet in interstellar battles. The goal is to destroy enemy ships before they destroy yours, using a variety of weapons and agile maneuvers to dodge incoming fire. Currently under development, with ongoing improvements to combat mechanics and detailed space environments.</p>

									<p>Time Track is a collaborative virtual reality project that explores the past, present, and future through an immersive journey. Designed as an interactive experience, it allows users to travel through different time periods, witnessing historical moments, the present world, and potential future scenarios. My role in this team-based project involved [mention your specific contributions, e.g., development, design, scripting, etc.].

										The project showcased our ability to merge storytelling with technology, creating an engaging and thought-provoking experience.</p>

										<h2> Saviour, vr experince </h2>

									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/ChatGPT Image May 27, 2025, 12_32_32 AM.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Saviour is a virtual reality experience I created to raise awareness about how to respond quickly during a stroke emergency. The idea came from a deeply personal moment in my life — I witnessed someone close to me suffer a sudden stroke. In that moment, I felt helpless, unsure of what to do, and overwhelmed by fear. That experience stayed with me and opened my eyes to how critical every second is when a stroke happens.

That’s where the idea for Saviour was born: an immersive, interactive experience that places the user in the middle of a high-stakes situation. The goal is to teach people how to recognize the early signs of a stroke (like facial drooping, arm weakness, and slurred speech) and take fast, life-saving action. Through this project, I wanted to combine technology with empathy — turning something I went through into something that could help others be more prepared and confident in an emergency.</p>

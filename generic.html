								<p>a 3d model for my that simualted my own living room , was my fisrt time in 3D modeling so it took me a week to complete it </p>

									<p>As part of a quick design challenge, I created a 3D vase in just 30 minutes. The goal was to test my speed and efficiency in modeling while maintaining a clean and visually appealing design. I focused on basic shape refinement, smooth curves, and proper proportions to achieve a polished look within the limited time.

										This challenge helped me improve my ability to work under time constraints while maintaining attention to detail. It was a fun and rewarding exercise that showcased my ability to think fast and execute efficiently in 3D modeling.</p>
                                    
										<p>Designed and created a detailed 3D model of a magic wand inspired by the iconic designs from Hogwarts Legacy for a collaborative project. Focused on capturing the intricate details and magical aesthetic to enhance the visual storytelling of the project. The model was optimized for real-time use and integrated seamlessly into the project environment. </p>

								<p>As part of my work in 3D modeling, I designed detailed 3D columns for a virtual stadium environment. These columns were created to enhance the architectural aesthetics and structural realism of the space. My design process involved careful consideration of proportions, and overall integration within the stadium scene to ensure a cohesive look </p>

								<p>To enhance the atmosphere of the virtual stadium, I designed a lake surrounding the stadium, adding a natural and immersive element to the environment. The reflective water surface and carefully placed details contribute to a more dynamic and visually appealing scene.</p>

								<p>To present the full scope of my virtual stadium project, I recorded a video walkthrough using Unity’s built-in recording tools. This video highlights the stadium’s architectural details, including the 3D columns I designed and the lake surrounding the environment, capturing the immersive atmosphere of the scene.

									The recording showcases the lighting, reflections, and overall composition, demonstrating how different elements come together to create a cohesive and realistic virtual space. This process allowed me to refine camera movements and scene transitions, ensuring a smooth and engaging presentation.</p>
